# Google Photos uploader CLI   

While the official tool only supports macOS and Windows, this brings an uploader to Linux too. Lets you upload photos from, in theory, any OS for which you can compile a Go program.     

See the [documentation site](https://gphotosuploader.github.io/gphotos-uploader-cli) for more information about this CLI.

## ðŸ“£ Help Wanted â€“ New Maintainers Needed ðŸ“£

If youâ€™re interested in becoming a maintainer [read the full announcement](https://github.com/gphotosuploader/gphotos-uploader-cli/issues/539). Your contribution will keep the project alive and improve it for the whole community.
