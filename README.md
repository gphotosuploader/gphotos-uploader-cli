# Google Photos uploader CLI   

While the official tool only supports Mac OS and Windows, this brings an uploader to Linux too. Lets you upload photos from, in theory, any OS for which you can compile a Go program.     

See the [documentation site](https://gphotosuploader.github.io/gphotos-uploader-cli) for more information about this CLI.
