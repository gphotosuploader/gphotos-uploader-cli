# Configuration

> The configuration is kept in the file `config.hjson` inside the configuration folder. You can specify your own folder using `--config /my/config/dir` otherwise default configuration folder is `~/.config/gphotos-uploader-cli`.

Example configuration file:    

```hjson
{
  SecretsBackendType: auto,
  APIAppCredentials: {
    ClientID:     "20637643488-1hvg8ev08r4tc16ca7j9oj3686lcf0el.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    ClientSecret: "0JyfLYw0kyDcJO-pGg5-rW_P",
  }
  jobs: [
    {
      account: youremail@gmail.com
      sourceFolder: ~/folder/to/upload
      makeAlbums: {
        enabled: true
        use: folderNames
      }
      deleteAfterUpload: false
      uploadVideos: true
      includePatterns: [ "*.jpg", "*.png" ]
      excludePatterns: [ "*ScreenShot*" ]
    }
  ]
}
```
### SecretsBackendType
This option allows you to choose which backend will be used for secrets storage. You set `auto` to allow the application decide which one will be used given your environment.

Available options for secrets backends are:

```
"auto"              For auto backend selection
"secret-service"    For gnome-keyring support
"keychain"          For OS X keychain support
"kwallet"           For KDE Secrets Manager support
"wincred"           For Windows credentials support
"file"              For encrypted file support - needs interation to supply a symetric encryption key
"pass"              For Password Store support - needs user interation to supply a GPG pass key
```

Most of the times `auto` is the proper one. The application will try to use the existing backends in the order [defined by the library](https://github.com/99designs/keyring/blob/2c916c935b9f0286ed72c22a3ccddb491c01c620/keyring.go#L28):

```
// This order makes sure the OS-specific backends
// are picked over the more generic backends.
var backendOrder = []BackendType{
	// Windows
	WinCredBackend,
	// MacOS
	KeychainBackend,
	// Linux
	SecretServiceBackend,
	KWalletBackend,
	// General
	PassBackend,
	FileBackend,
}
```

## APIAppCredentials

Given that `gphotos-uploader-cli` uses OAuth 2 to access Google APIs, authentication is a bit tricky and envolves a few manual steps. Please follow the guide below carefully, to give `gphotos-uploader-cli` the required access to your Google Photos account.

Before you can use `gphotos-uploader-cli`, you must enable the Photos Library API and request an OAuth 2.0 Client ID.

1. Make sure you're logged in into the Google Account where your photos should be uploaded to.
1. Start by [creating a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) in Google Cloud Platform and give it a name (example: _Google Photos Uploader_).
1. Enable the [Google Photos Library API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/photoslibrary.googleapis.com) by clicking the <kbd>ENABLE</kbd> button.
1. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) by setting the application name (example: _gphotos-uploader-cli_) and then click the <kbd>Save</kbd> button on the bottom.
1. Create [credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) by clicking the **Create credentials â†’ OAuth client ID** option, then pick **Other** as the application type and give it a name (example: _gphotos-uploader-cli_).
1. Copy the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** and keep them ready to use in the next step.
1. Open the *config file* and set both the `ClientID` and `ClientSecret` options to the ones generated on the previous step.

## jobs
List of folders to upload and upload options for each folder.

### `account`
Needs to be unique. It's the Google Account identity (e-mail address) where the files of this job are going to be uploaded.

### `sourceFolder`
The folder to upload from.
Must be an absolute path. Can expand the home folder tilde shorthand.

### `makeAlbums`
If makeAlbums.enabled set to true, use the last folder path component as album name.

### `deleteAfterUpload`
If set to true, media will be deleted from local disk after upload. 

> **NOTE:** This option was not working properly prior v0.6.0.

### `uploadVideos`
> **DEPRECATION NOTICE:** This option will be deprecated in the future in favor of `_ALL_VIDEO_FILES_` tagged pattern used in `includePatterns` or `excludePatterns`.

If set to `true`, video media items will be included (uploaded). If `false`, video files will be excluded.

If you want to upload video files (`uploadVideos: true`), you can use:
```
includePatterns: [ "_ALL_VIDEO_FILES_" ]
excludePatterns: []
```

If you don't want to upload video files (`uploadVideos: false`), you can use:
```
includePatterns: [ "_ALL_FILES_" ]
excludePatterns: [ "_ALL_VIDEO_FILES_" ]
```

**NOTE:** It means that as far as `uploadVideos` options is present, video files are always included or excluded,

## Including and Excluding files
You can include and exclude files by specifying the `includePatterns` and `excludePatterns` options. You can add one or more patterns separated by commas `,`. These patterns are always applied to `sourceFolder`.

For example, to upload all _JPG and PNG files_ that are not named _*ScreenShots*_ you can configure it like this:
```
includePatterns: [ "*.jpg", "*.png" ]
excludePatterns: [ "*ScreenShot*" ]
```

### Patterns
Patterns use [filepath.Glob](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Glob) internally, see [filepath.Match](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match) for syntax. 

Regular wildcards cannot be used to match over the directory separator `/`. For example: `b*ash` matches `/dir/bash` but does not match `/dirb/ash`.

For this, the special wildcard `**` can be used to match arbitrary sub-directories: The pattern `foo/**/bar` matches:

* `/dir1/foo/dir2/bar/file`
* `/foo/bar/file`
* `/tmp/foo/bar`

#### Tagged patterns
There are some common patterns that has been tagged, you can use them to simplify your configuration.

* `_ALL_FILES_`: Matches all files, is the same as using `*`. 
* `_ALL_VIDEO_FILES_`: Matches all video file extensions supported by Google Photos.
> Supported video extensions are sourced by [Google Photos support](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/6193313) and it includes:
> .mpg, .mod, .mmv, .tod, .wmv, .asf, .avi, .divx, .mov, .m4v, .3gp, .3g2, .mp4, .m2t, .m2ts, .mts, and .mkv files.
